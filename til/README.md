# Project "Today I Learned"

## What is this?

A "Today I Learned" themed page/blog designed to keep track of daily learnings. Heavily Inspired by the excellent project of [Hashrocket](https://til.hashrocket.com/)

## How it works?

- It uses another github repo by myself [get-gists-for-given-user](https://github.com/hibernationTheory/get-gists-for-given-user) to fetch the gists for a given user that has given prefix (`_til` in this case).

- Creates a json file from the fetched gists and uses the json file to display the data in the page.

- Relies mostly on Webpack and React.

## Motivation

To keep track of learnings and build up handson knowledge in React.
